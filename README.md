## Overview
This project is a Gradio-based application that processes Tamil audio file or live voice record Tamil audio to multiple AI tasks as mentioned below.

1. **Transcription**: Tamil audio ‚Üí Tamil text
2. **Translation**: Tamil text ‚Üí English text
3. **Image Generation**: English text ‚Üí AI-generated image
4. **Text Generation**: English text ‚Üí Further text generation

## Models Used
| Task                     | Model Name                              | Provider     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Transcription**        | `whisper-large-v3`                     | Groq API    |
| **Translation**          | `gemma2-9b-it`                         | Groq API    |
| **Image Generation**     | `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell`     | Hugging Face |
| **Text Generation**      | `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`        | Groq API    |

## Requirements
1. **gradio**
2. **requests**
3. **pillow**
4. **groq**

## Secret Variable Setup
You must set up the Groq API key as a secret variable.
### Steps to Add Secrets in Hugging Face Spaces
1. Go to your Hugging Face Space (the project where you're deploying your Gradio app).
2. Click on the "Settings" tab (inside the Space, not your account settings).
3. Scroll down to the "Repository Secrets" section.
4. Click "Add a new secret" and enter:
    Name: groq_api
    Value: Your Groq API key
5. Click "Save".

**NOTE:** There is no need of Hugging Face Access Token as I deployed this Gradio app in the Hugging Face Space itself. If you are going to try this code outside Hugging Face you need to provide access token.

## Usage
Run the script app.py
This will launch a Gradio web interface where user can upload a Tamil audio file or live voice record Tamil audio and receive processed results.

## Example Output
- **Tamil Audio Input:** üé§ (User uploads an audio file or live record)
- **Transcribed Tamil Text:** "‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç ‡Æâ‡Æ∞‡Øà"
- **Translated English Text:** "Example Tamil text"
- **Generated Image:** üñºÔ∏è (AI-generated image displayed)
- **Generated Text:** "This is a creative continuation..."
